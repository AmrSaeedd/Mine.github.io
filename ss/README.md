# CS50 Store
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This is my CS50 final project, which is a web app pizza store built with HTML, CSS, Js, Sqlite and Flask. To use this website, it requires all customers to create an account first in order to buy the pizza they want from the site. After the user has created their own account, it will provide 2000 dollars by default.
### Itnroduction
